## Portfolio

Listed here are some of my work. 

### Basic of Data Science Presentation
This is the presentation I've done up to demonstrate how Data Science is being employed in Autonomous Vehicle. Below are some of the slides. What was not included in the slides are my presentation on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) employed in Autonomous Vehicle to aid in image feature extraction and adding the temporal factor to predict the possibilities of object collision.

### Capstone Project 1 - HR Attrition Dasboard
This is an individual project done over 5 days. I've downloaded the IBM Watson dataset from Kaggle, clean it up and did some transformation via Power Query. I've found that the dataset has quite a worrying 20% employee attrition. This will impact the company talent retention as most of the employee who left are the younger ones. On top of that, the company has already been giving the employees quite an attractive salary with a good salary hike. The root of the cause from the analysis points toward the Overtime factor. About half of the employees who work Overtime left the company. Therefore, the company has to take a closer look at this situation.

I also did a Logistic Regression prediction model using Excel Solver. I've used a 80-20 train test split to generate up my model. With the trained Logistic Regression coefficient, I can then used it to predict whether an employee will stay/leave the company based on the latter profile.
